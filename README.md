# DayByDay

## Description

This assignment tasked us to use Jquery, while updating the starter code.  We used the current time, and apllied certain classes to the time-blocks: (past, present & future). 
We also provided the ability to save a new event, to local-storage, and recall said info when the page is loaded.
